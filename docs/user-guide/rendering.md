# Rendering

`splax.inference.render` is the pure, grad-free forward path. It calls the
projection and rasterization FFI primals directly, so there is no `jax.custom_vjp`
interception and no residual saving. Calling `jax.grad` through it raises by
design. For gradients use [`splax.training.render`](training.md).

```python
img = splax.inference.render(
    means, scales, quats, colors, opacities,
    viewmat=viewmat, background=jnp.ones(3),
    img_shape=(H, W), f=(fx, fy), c=(W // 2, H // 2),
    glob_scale=1.0, clip_thresh=0.01,
)  # (H, W, 3)
```

## Inputs

| Argument | Shape | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `means` | `(N, 3)` | World positions |
| `scales` | `(N, 3)` | Positive per-axis scales |
| `quats` | `(N, 4)` | Unit wxyz quaternions |
| `colors` | `(N, 3)` | RGB in `[0, 1]` |
| `opacities` | `(N, 1)` | Opacity in `[0, 1]` |

## Camera conventions

`viewmat` is a `(4, 4)` world-to-camera matrix in the OpenCV convention (+z
forward, +y down, +x right). This is what COLMAP stores directly. NeRF and
OpenGL poses (-z forward) must be converted first, as `scripts/train_lego.py`
does by multiplying the camera-to-world matrix by `diag(1, -1, -1, 1)` before
inverting.

`f` is the focal length `(fx, fy)` in pixels and `c` is the principal point
`(cx, cy)`. `img_shape` is `(H, W)`. `glob_scale` multiplies every gaussian
scale, and `clip_thresh` is the near-plane depth cutoff.

## Backgrounds

`background` is a length-3 RGB color composited behind the splat where
transmittance remains. It is a constant and is not differentiated.

## Antialiased mode

`antialiased=True` applies the Mip-Splatting opacity compensation. A per-gaussian
factor from `splax.opacity_compensation` is multiplied into the blend opacity,
cancelling the area inflation that thin gaussians gain from the projection's
screen-space dilation. The tile intersection still counts with the raw opacity.
Default `False` is byte-identical to the plain path. Use the same setting at
inference that a model was trained with.

## Low-level primitives

`splax.inference.render` composes two `jax.custom_vjp` primitives that are also
public.

- `splax.project` maps gaussians to screen-space `(xys, depths, radii, conics, num_tiles_hit, cum_tiles_hit)`.
- `splax.rasterize` blends the projected gaussians into the `(H, W, 3)` image.

The Warp backend caches grow-only sort and bin scratch across renders.
`splax.clear_scratch` releases it, for example before switching to a very
different workload size.
