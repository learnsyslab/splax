camera pose, and the rigid transforms. One backward kernel computes every gradient in a single pass,

    gaussians.

    The factor is computed in closed form from the projection's conics, so its gradient flows back
    to the scales, quaternions, and means through the existing projection vjp without any Warp
    kernel change. For a conic with entries ``a``, ``b``, and ``c`` the ratio is
    ``1 - eps (a + c) + eps^2 (a c - b^2)``, clipped to ``[0, 1]`` for float safety. Culled
