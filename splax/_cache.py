"""Warp backend caches shared by the rasterization pipeline.

Rasterization first sorts the Gaussians and computes the total intersection count. The count is read
back on the host to size the pipeline buffers. Warp cannot update a captured CUDA graph, so the
pipeline launches its kernels individually once the count is known. To accelerate the launches as
much as possible, we keep three per-device caches that avoid allocations and kernel repacks.

The launch cache records each kernel as a Warp launch object keyed on kernel and device. A full
wp.launch repacks and validates every argument and costs 5 to 16 us of host time per launch. A
recorded launch replays in about 2 us and repacks only the arguments whose recorded state changed
since the previous call. Most inputs stay fixed across frames, so the diff repacks little.

The scratch cache holds the sort and bin buffers keyed on the workload shape over batch size,
Gaussian count, and tile count. The buffers are reused across renders and only grow, which avoids a
cold reallocation of several gigabytes each frame. A change in workload shape drops the whole entry.
An intersection count above the current capacity reallocates the sort buffers with headroom, at the
cost of a longer compute time on that call.

The readback cache holds one pinned int32 staging element per device for the single
intersection-count copy, fenced with an event. A pageable readback allocates every frame and costs
about 17 us of host time, while the pinned copy and its event sync cost about 6 us.

A recorded launch retains raw pointers into the scratch buffers, so the launch cache and the scratch
cache are purged together whenever the scratch buffers move. The readback cache holds no such
references and is independent of the other two.
