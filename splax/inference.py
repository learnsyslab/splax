"""splax.inference: the pure, guaranteed grad-free rendering entry point.

``splax.inference.render`` is the inference-only twin of ``splax.training.render``.
Both share every Warp kernel; they differ only in the JAX-level wrapping:

- **No custom_vjp.** This path calls the projection / rasterization FFI *primals*
  (``_project_call`` / ``_rasterize_call``) directly, so there is no
  ``jax.custom_vjp`` interception and no residual-saving forward rule on the trace.
  Calling ``jax.grad`` through it raises (the FFIs have no autodiff rule) -- that is
  intentional: this is the documented grad-free contract.
- **No residual outputs.** The rasterize FFI always computes ``final_Ts`` /
  ``final_idx`` (they are cheap forward by-products), but this path discards them.
  Because nothing downstream reads them, XLA dead-code-eliminates them from the
  compiled program -- unlike the training forward, which must keep them live as
  custom_vjp residuals for the backward.
- **Tight O6 intersection** (opacity-aware SNUGBOX + AccuTile) is always used.
- **Batching.** vmap over viewmats/splats works exactly as in the training path
  (both underlying FFIs carry ``vmap_method="expand_dims"``).

The math is identical to ``splax.render`` on the forward; this module adds no new
kernels, only a grad-free wiring of the existing ones.
