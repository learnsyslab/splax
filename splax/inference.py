"""Grad-free rendering entry point.

splax.inference.render shares every Warp kernel with splax.training.render and
differs only in the JAX wrapping. It calls the projection and rasterization FFI
primals directly, so there is no custom_vjp on the trace and jax.grad through it
raises. The blend residuals final_Ts and final_idx are discarded, and because
nothing downstream reads them XLA dead-code-eliminates them from the compiled
program. The training forward must keep them alive as backward residuals.

This path also supports rigid transforms tied to gaussians for composed dynamic
scenes. Non-overlapping slices of the gaussians each follow their own 4x4
transform, applied on the fly inside the projection kernel, so the base splat is
never duplicated. Under jax.vmap over the transform stack every batch element
moves the same gaussians differently while the splat itself stays broadcast.

    gaussian_transforms is an optional (K, 4, 4) stack of rigid world-space
    transforms and gaussian_slices the K matching non-overlapping (start, stop)
    index ranges. The gaussians in slice k move by gaussian_transforms[k], all

    kernel without copying the splat. Batching works through jax.vmap over the

    renders the same scene with its gaussians at different poses. The slices are
    static Python values. Omitting both arguments is the plain path with
