"""Warp port of the reference CUDA rasterization stage (forward only), batch-native.

Ports the reference CUDA rasterizer (map_gaussian_to_intersects,
get_tile_bin_edges, rasterize_fwd, and its XLA op glue) faithfully
into Warp kernels, wrapped as a JAX FFI call via jax_callable. The callable:

  1. reads back num_intersects = cum_tiles_hit[-1] (one legitimate D->H sync),
  2. allocates scratch (isect keys, gaussian ids, tile bins) of that size,
  3. emits 64-bit intersection keys (image_id | tile_id | depth_bits) per
     gaussian/tile,
  4. sorts them once, globally (stable 64-bit radix sort),
  5. computes per-(image,tile) bin edges,
  6. blends front-to-back with per-pixel early termination.

Batching is native (gsplat O1). Under jax.vmap(expand_dims) the callable
launches a single grid over the whole batch (B*N for projection-derived stages,
B*num_tiles tile-blocks for the blend); the batch/image index is decoded from the
thread/block rank, packed into the sort key (image id above the tile bits), and
used to offset per-image bin edges, outputs, and backgrounds -- exactly gsplat's
launch-once design, no host loop. Per-input "batched or broadcast" indexing lets
projection intermediates arrive at full batch B while colors/opacities/background
may be broadcast (size 1). For B=1 every path reduces to the unbatched kernel.

Because of the host readback + data-dependent scratch alloc, this callable is NOT
CUDA-graph capturable, so graph_mode=NONE.

The public entry point returns the rendered image.

# pixels in registers, staging shared batches of only CTA_SIZE (64) gaussians.
# The 64 threads form a 16-wide x 4-tall lane grid; a thread's 4 pixels stride
# down the tile by ROW_STRIDE=4 rows (same column), covering all 16 rows. This
# reads each staged gaussian record 64x instead of 256x (4x less shared traffic
# per gaussian) and hides expf latency across the 4-pixel ILP; smaller batches
# give finer-grained early-exit. _USE_CTA64 selects the default at launch.

# dense, blend-bound configs ~3x (train.ply 512^2: 17.7 vs 5.9 ms) and is only
# break-even on sparse clouds, so the 256-thread/1-pixel kernel stays the default.
# gsplat's win from register-blocked pixels does not carry over: at 64 threads the

# --- Persistent grow-only scratch cache (survey O3) ---------------------------
# The rasterize pipeline needs three per-frame buffers whose sizes depend on the
# (data-dependent) intersection count:
#   * isect_ids / gaussian_ids -- the radix-sort key/value ping-pong buffers. Warp's
#     wp.utils.radix_sort_pairs mandates a 2*count backing array because it drives a
#     cub::DoubleBuffer(keys, keys+count) internally (the 2N *is* the double buffer;
#     it is already the "halved aux" state gsplat gets from cub::DoubleBuffer, and
#     CUB's own temp storage is separately grow-only cached per stream inside warp).
#   * tile_bins -- the per-(image, tile) bin-edge array of length B*num_tiles.
# Re-allocating these from warp's mempool every frame costs a cold ~14 ms re-malloc
# of ~3 GB at B=8/1M/1080p (warm ~6 ms). We keep one set of buffers per device,
# keyed on the static shape signature (B, N, num_tiles): callers invoke this from
# jitted JAX functions, so the signature is fixed per compiled executable and
# repeated calls reuse stable-address buffers with zero mempool traffic. When the
# signature changes (new workload), everything is dropped and re-allocated, so a
# big config's scratch never lingers into a smaller one. Within one signature the
# sort buffers still track the running max of the (data-dependent, per-viewpoint)
# intersection count with 1.25x headroom, settling to zero reallocations after
# the first frames.
# Correctness notes:
#   * Keyed on device (per-device correctness); single stream / single process, so
#     no locking is needed.
#   * The sort key/id buffers are fully overwritten in their valid [0, num_intersects)
#     prefix every frame (every intersection slot is written exactly once by the map
#     kernel; culled gaussians contribute 0 tiles), so no stale-data hazard there.
#   * tile_bins is the exception: the bin-edge kernel only touches bins that own
#     intersections, leaving empty bins at their default (0, 0) = empty range. So the
#     used prefix MUST be explicitly zeroed each frame before the kernel runs.
#   * rasterize runs graph_mode=NONE (host readback + data-dependent shapes are not
#     CUDA-graph capturable), so reused buffer addresses raise no stale-capture
#     hazard; they are simply reused eagerly.

# The one-block-per-tile blend makes frame time follow the HEAVIEST tile's
# depth-sorted bin (reports/phase1.md, phase4b.md): a dense scene at low resolution
# lands in few tiles with one enormous bin (~80k gaussians at 512^2) while most
# tiles idle, so a handful of blocks grind serially on idle SMs. Alpha compositing
# is associative over depth-ordered segments -- a segment blends to (C_seg, T_seg)
# and two adjacent segments combine as C = C_a + T_a*C_b, T = T_a*T_b -- so a heavy
# tile's bin can be split into K contiguous depth-ordered sub-ranges, each blended
# by its own block in parallel, then merged per pixel by a tiny composite pass.
# This trades the heaviest tile's serial depth (~max_bin) for max_bin/K, filling the
# idle SMs (FlashGS / Balanced-3DGS / gsplat load-balancing family).
#
# Applied ONLY to the pure-inference blend (splax.inference.render): the training
# forward keeps final_Ts/final_idx as backward residuals, and the segment split
# reorders the per-pixel final_idx bookkeeping, so the differentiable path stays on
# the unsplit kernel (byte-identical, backward untouched). Inference discards those
# residuals, so only out_img must match -- and it does to a few ULP (segment
# compositing only reorders float adds across segment boundaries).

#   depth_bits = 31 - (image_n_bits + tile_n_bits)  (>=16 when packing)
# The top bit (31, the sign) is always 0, so cub's signed-int radix sort orders the

#      split_threshold are cut into K = min(ceil(count/threshold), kcap) contiguous
#      depth-ordered segments; the plan (compacted via two device atomics) records
#      per-split metadata and a per-segment work list. Light tiles produce nothing
#      here (they are blended by _rasterize_fwd_unsplit).
#   2. _rasterize_fwd_seg -- one 256-thread block per segment (worst-case launch,
#      device-count guarded). Byte-identical blend math to _rasterize_fwd over the
#      segment's sub-range, writing per-pixel partials (C_seg, T_seg) to a slot buffer
#      keyed on the compact split index. No background term (the composite adds it).
#   3. _composite_tile_split -- one thread per pixel of each split tile (device-count
#      guarded). Merges the K partials front-to-back: C = Σ (Π_{s'<s} T_s') C_s,
#      T = Π T_s, writing out_img = C + T*bg. Non-split tiles are already final.

# Plain per-pixel port of backward.cu::rasterize_bwd. One thread per pixel walks
# the tile's gaussians back-to-front from the saved final_idx down to the tile's
# first intersection, reconstructing T by dividing out (1-alpha) and accumulating
# parameter gradients with plain wp.atomic_add into the per-gaussian grad buffers.
# (A block-reduction variant exists behind SPLAX_BWD_REDUCE, below.)
#
# Residual flow (recompute-not-store design): the sort/bin structures (gaussian_ids_sorted,
# tile_bins) are NOT saved from the forward; they are recomputed here from the
# saved cum_tiles_hit via the shared _sort_and_bin (deterministic -> reproduces the
# forward order, so the saved final_Ts/final_idx line up). ``tight`` must match the
# forward so the key emission is identical.
#
# v_out_alpha is 0: the public rasterize returns only the image (no alpha channel),
# so the alpha cotangent is zero, as in the reference img.sum()-style grads.

# cotangent). v_depths then flows through project's backward (which already consumes
# v_depths) to means/scales/quats/viewmat. Background depth is 0, so the
