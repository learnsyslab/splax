"""splax, an NVIDIA Warp gaussian-splatting pipeline for JAX.

Projection, rasterization, and their backward passes run as Warp kernels behind JAX FFI calls, so
scenes render fast and fit with jax.grad.

splax.render is the rendering entry point. It is differentiable with respect to the gaussian
parameters, the camera pose, and per-object rigid transforms.
