"""Fixed-budget MCMC training utilities.

This module ports the core mechanics of "3D Gaussian Splatting as Markov Chain Monte Carlo" by
Kheradmand et al. from gsplat to JAX. Every op keeps the gaussian count fixed and works as a mask,
gather, and scatter over the full array, so it composes with ``jax.jit`` and a static optax state
without the densification that grows the gaussian count in the original strategy.

``relocate`` teleports dead gaussians onto alive ones sampled in proportion to opacity. It corrects
opacity and scale so the gaussians that now share a location preserve the original contribution, and
it reports which rows need their optimizer moments reset. ``inject_noise`` perturbs the means with
covariance and opacity weighted Gaussian noise every step, so low-opacity gaussians random-walk to
explore the scene while high-opacity ones stay put.

The relocation math matches gsplat's CUDA relocation kernel, and ``tests/test_mcmc.py`` checks
parity against a direct transcription of it.
